# The Hungry Colleague

A simple challenge for people interviewing for developer roles at one of my previous roles.

## The Spoonacular API

Please create an account at https://spoonacular.com/food-api 

You will be using the following endpoints:

### The application

The application should show a paginated list of recipes with images and basic details:

Provide a menu allowing the user to search recipes in 2 ways:

When a user clicks the *view recipe* links, show a modal with the complete recipe information:
